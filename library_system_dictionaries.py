# Library System - a small library system to describe and keep track of books using dictionaries.
# Name: Ruarai Kirk

# Course: DT265A

# Below are the specific functions of the Library System:
# A Python function that prints details about all the books in the library.

# Library
# The library is implemented as a dictionary, with the keys being the book ISBN (13-digits) and the values being the
# details (such as title, author and quantity) implemented in a list

# Notes for further improvement:
# 1. When searching for a book's isbn using the title, the title has to be inputted exactly (case sensitive etc.)
# To improve this, I would implement an all lower case value in the library, and strip the user input of case using the
# ascii 'lowercase method.

# 2. The title search function only returns a value when successful. This should be amended to return a message with a
# negative value or error message if required.

# 3. At present, the above library system only records number of books 'in stock', and not total quantity. The above
# should be amended to show this by including another value in the value list.
