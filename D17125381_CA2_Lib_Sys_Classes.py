# Continuous Assessment 2 â€“ Library system using CLASSES
# Ruarai Kirk - D17125381 - DT265A

# Notes for assessment:
# 1. Error Checking
#       There has been minimal error checking included in this program, which I realise is a major risk. Sufficient error checking would
#       involve many more lines of code. Some error checking which would need to be resolved from the outset would be:
#           a. Random ID generator - check that ID generated is not already in use
#           b. User input - for all aspects, especially in for the search, borrow/return, add/remove functions (when testing this program copy
#              and pasting of library item/member attributes, or careful case sensitive input, is required).
